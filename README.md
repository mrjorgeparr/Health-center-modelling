# Health-center-modelling
Models a grid of health centers through a non-directed graph like data structure. It implements Bellman-Ford and Floyd-Warshal dynamic programming algorithms for finding the shortest path among all different centers.
This project was part of a Data Structures and algorithms course done in UC3M.
